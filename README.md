# Weather or Not Weather App

## This weather application will allow a user to search a city and provide the current day's weather as well as the forecast for 5 days in the future.

This page uses moment.js to get the current and future dates. Also, it uses a combination of the Current Day weather api https://openweathermap.org/current and then extracts the longitude and latitude from the city to use the One Call weather API https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api for the forecast.
