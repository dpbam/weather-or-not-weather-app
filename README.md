# Whether or Not Weather App

## This weather application will provide the current day's weather as well as the forecast for 5 days in the future.

# This page uses moment.js to get the current and future dates. Also, it uses a combination of the Current Day weather api https://openweathermap.org/current and then extracts the longitude and latitude from the city to use the One Call weather API https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api for the forecast.

This was a very hard challenge for me with several moving parts. I had trouble with pretty much every part, but I gained an understanding of API calls and how to get the data from them. I haven't been able to figure out how to use LocalStorage to store the cities the user searches for. I'll keep working on it.
